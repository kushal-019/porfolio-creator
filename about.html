      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="h2">
        This is a project to build a portfolio website which is made by a group
        of 4 from 2210991832 to 2210991835. A portfolio website is essentially
        an online resume or digital portfolio that provides a visual
        representation of your work. The goals of building a portfolio site can
        vary depending on your personal and professional objectives.

        <p class="h2">
          The problem statement that a portfolio website helps us with is that
          it can be difficult to showcase our skills, experience, and
          accomplishments to potential employers, clients, or collaborators in a
          competitive job market. Traditional resumes and cover letters may not
          provide enough information or context to effectively communicate our
          value proposition.
          <br />

          A portfolio website provides a solution to this problem by offering a
          platform for us to showcase our work in a visually appealing and
          interactive way. It can help us stand out in a crowded job market and
          connect with potential clients or employers on a more personal and
          engaging level. <br />

          Overall, the problem that a portfolio website helps us with is how to
          effectively and creatively communicate our value proposition to
          potential employers, clients, or collaborators in a digital age.
